# PhotoListApp<br>
*I built my application using CoreData.<br>
*By taking a photo from the camera or adding a photo from the gallery, we enter the title and description of the photo.<br>
*Added photos are listed in tableView.<br>
*We can select a photo in the list and change its title and description.<br>
*We can delete a photo in the list by swiping right.
